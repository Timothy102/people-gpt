# PartnerHQ TimC Take Home Task: "PeopleGPT"

I used Mistral-7B for NaiveRAG(query + retrieval) & Self-Query RAG to try and build a "people search engine". The majority of the work can be found in both notebooks. You've been added as a private collaborator to the private repo here.

## Running the Frontend and Backend
To run the frontend and backend components of the "PeopleGPT" project, follow these steps:

1. **Frontend:**
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
   - Run `npm start` to start the frontend server.

2. **Backend:**
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install Python dependencies.
   - Run `python app.py` to start the backend server.
